# Airbnb Sample Data Seeding

This SQL script (`seed.sql`) populates the Airbnb database with sample data for testing and development.

## 📄 seed.sql

The script inserts:

- 👤 3 Users (guest, host, admin)
- 🏡 2 Properties listed by the host
- 📅 2 Bookings made by the guest
- 💳 1 Payment for a confirmed booking
- ⭐ 1 Review left by a guest
- 💬 1 Message from guest to host

Use this data to test database queries and logic related to booking flow.

Run this script after `schema.sql` using any SQL-compatible tool.
